	          RECIPE FOR KULCHA
	-----------------------------------------

PREPARATION TIME : 15 Minutes

    INGREDIENTS

4 cup all purpose flour
1/2 cup water
1 1/2 cup lukewarm milk
2 tablespoon virgin olive oil
1 teaspoon dry yeast
2 teaspoon sugar
1/2 teaspoon salt
1/4 cup butter

  METHOD
1. First of all, add yeast and sugar in lukewarm water, mix them lightly and leave for 5-10 min or till it become frothy. 
    Add flour, warm milk and salt in yeast mixture and combine all the ingredients together.
2. Knead for 5 minutes and let it rest for few minutes. Again, knead it for some minutes to get a nice soft dough. Initially, it may seems to be too sticky but after kneading 
    for long you will get a nice non-sticky soft dough.
3. Knead the dough by pulling and stretching it, instead of applying too much pressure on your dough. Grease the dough with oil and keep it aside, 
    covered with a cloth to rise, till it doubles in volume.
4. When it becomes double in volume, then punch the dough and again knead for a minute or two. Keep the dough in refrigerator for slow rise.
5. Take a tennis ball size of dough and flatten it. Now, roll it in a nice thick round/oblong shape using rolling pin and some dry flour. Now, place it on a preheated tawa and cover with a lid. 
    Cook it on medium to low flame till you see the bubbles rising on the upper side of the dough.
6. Now flip it and apply some butter all over it. Keep flipping and cooking till it gets nice golden patches on both sides. When both sides are cooked and golden, serve hot.
